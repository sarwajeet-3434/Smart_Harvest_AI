# 🌾 SmartHarvest AI

**SmartHarvest AI** is an AI-powered agricultural intelligence platform designed to predict crop yields and assess climate risks across Indian districts. By integrating climate analytics with machine learning, the platform helps farmers, researchers, and policymakers make informed agricultural decisions that improve productivity and reduce climate-related risks.

The system analyzes rainfall, temperature, humidity, soil moisture, vegetation indices (NDVI), and historical crop production data to generate accurate yield predictions and climate risk assessments through an interactive dashboard.
